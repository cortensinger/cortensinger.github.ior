This web application prototype is a project for CS 294-84, a graduate class at UC Berkeley centered around Interactive Device Design. For this particular project, we created a device to help identify and reduce possible causes of delirium in hospital patients. There is a recent effort at UCSF to prevent symptoms of delirium from arising in patients during their stay at the hosptial for illnesses that are often unrelated to delirium altogether. Our device fuses together three main sensors that detect light levels, sound levels and movement in the patients room on a 24 hour basis with the hopes of uncovering potential reasons as to why particular patients may experience the onset of delirium during their stay. Also, we included a speaker in our device that acts as a way to maintain communication between patients and their families, while simultaneously providing auditory stimulation to the patient at times when their senses may be particularly deprived.

In an attempt to assist UCSF's delirium reduction campaign, we aim to take advantage of well known non-pharmacological interventions, which include: (1) Avoiding sleep deprivation; (2) Addressing cognitive impairment with cognitive stimulation; (3) Minimizing sensory deprivation such as hearing impairment. By sensing and tracking the patient's environment, our device offers detailed information to nurses and doctors that could help point out potential contributing factors to the delirium, such as difficulty sleeping (detected either by the device's motion sensor or microphone during night hours) or perhaps a constant lack of stimulation (detected by long periods of silence). By incorporating a speaker into the device, loved ones can be alerted when it is particularly appropriate to send an audio message to check-in with their patient (ie, not during sleep, but during moments of extended quiet), which helps provide meaningful stimulation.

This web application that works in tandem with the device serves as both a means to log the patient's environment for the benefit of the nursing staff and as a window through which the patient's loved ones can monitor their status from home. This is especially helpful if the patient's relatives are unable to visit for whatever reason. Further, this monitoring can assist the nursing staff by having extra caretakers watch over the patient's condition: if anything suspicious is noticed, it can be reported to the staff without them having to be physically present. This web app also functions as a communication bridge between the patient and their loved ones by providing the option to send audio messages from the website directly to the device!
